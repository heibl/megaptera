  \item 
Since the publication of version 1.0-0 on CRAN, \code{megaptera} has been massively extended and major parts have been rewritten. Because of the large number of changes I resign to list any details, in particular because the new version is not compatible with 1.0-0 due to changes in the structure of the underlying database. Any existing \code{megaptera} projects will have to be rerun from scratch, but this inconvenience is compensated for by extended functionality, shorter runtimes, and improved data consistency. The fully updated and extended vignette will help you to do so. I hope you will enjoy the new version.
